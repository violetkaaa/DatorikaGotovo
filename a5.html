        In new draft guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved nivolumab through the fast-track Cancer Drugs Fund (4) <input type="text" id="answer4">
        more evidence is gathered on its cost-effectiveness. That means some patients — about 1,300 people with advanced squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (whose tumours express a molecule called PD-L1) — will now be eligible for the drug.
        The former smoker, AA Gill, was diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to his neck and pancreas, with tumours that were inoperable and unsuitable for radiotherapy. Gill said he had been denied a drug — costing about £5,000 a month — that (5)<input type="text" id="answer5">

        What is Nivolumab?
        Nivolumab (brand name Opdivo) is a type of immunotherapy that stimulates the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. It works by interrupting the chemical signals that cancers use to convince the immune system they are healthy tissue. Patients can have nivolumab injected into a vein as a drip. It is used to treat advanced melanoma, blood cancer (Hodgkin lymphoma), kidney cancer and the most common type of lung cancer — non small-cell lung cancer. It is also used in clinical trials for (6)<input type="text" id="answer6">
        types of cancer.
        Prof Carole Longson, from NICE, said: "We know that nivolumab is clinically effective for some people with lung cancer, but the full extent of its benefit is not clear. This new deal means that we can (7) <input type="text" id="answer7">

        Prof Paul Workman, from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said: "Immunotherapies are currently very expensive, but one of the ways to make them more cost-effective is to direct them to patients most (8) <input type="text" id="answer8">
